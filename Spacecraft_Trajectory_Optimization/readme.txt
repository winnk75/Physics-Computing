In this folder you’ll find all the good stuff from my Computational Physics final project. I’ve been interested in the Hohmann Transfer problem since high school, and it’s one of the reasons I decided to major in physics in the first place, but I never had a chance to explore it in this level of detail until now. Over five (ish) weeks, a friend and I made it our mission to generate “porkchop” plots, which are optimization plots depicting the best time to launch a spacecraft from Earth to Mars.

This project started with just the basics: a few pages in a notebook (shown here) and a quick python script that numerically calculates the trajectory of a circular orbit (numerical solution to a second order differential equation). Once we determined a reasonable balance between accuracy and speed, we moved on to more complicated elliptical orbits. Eventually, we implemented an optimization algorithm to search for minima in our differential equation. Finally, we added real ephemeris data for Earth and Mars, and generated an actual porkchop plot. In the end, we were limited by computational resources (I was running simulations overnight on a MacBook Pro), but we generated a wonderful proof of concept porkchop plot!


In this directory you’ll find the test cases that ultimately took us from our first step to our final step. Everything is named “test” because at first everything was a test, and we never really got to renaming the codes. I decided to leave it that way for this repo because it allows a view into our thought process through the project. You can see what we were thinking about, worrying about, and learning by seeing the iterative process as the codes get more complex.

As a final word of warning, some of the later codes can literally take all night to run, so tone down the number of iterations or simulation steps if you want to seriously execute them.
